# Weighted-Round-Robin-Arbiter -Assertion-Based-Verification
This project implements a weighted round-robin arbiter in SystemVerilog for sharing resources between multiple requesters. Each requester is given a weight, and grants are given based on weight and round-robin order. The design is verified using SystemVerilog assertions with a reference model.
